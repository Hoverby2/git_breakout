    "**Git** is a **version control system (VCS)** that lets you track changes to files over time. These files can be any kind of file (eg doc, pdf, xls), but free text differences are most easily visible (eg txt, csv, md). You can rollback changes made by you, or others. This facilitates a **playground for collaboration**, without fear of experimentation (you can always rollback changes).\n",

It's mostly designed to facilitate a technical conversation between commits, pull requests, issues and particular lines of code. It's also great for **project management**, with the ability to link issues, milestones and commits.\n"

You can add these files by executing git add filename(e.g., following the example above: git add NEWFILE). When you run git status now, you will see that NEWFILE is green, which means it is tracked by GitHub. After you are done with all your edits, you can push your changes to your online branch. Every push in Github first requires a commit where you clarify what edits you made. A typical commit would look like this git commit -m \"added file NEWFILE\". Run this command. Now, you are ready to push your changes to your branch (always reminds me of a great song). Note that if it is your first push to your branch you must declare an \"upstream\" branch by running git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME (e.g., git push --set-upstream origin fhopp).
